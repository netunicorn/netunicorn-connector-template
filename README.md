# netunicorn-connector-template
This is a template repository for creating a new connector for the netunicorn platform.

## How to use this template
Use the code from `src/netunicorn/contrib/connectors/connector_name.py` as a starting point for your connector. The code is commented and should be self-explanatory.
In addition, you can read the NetunicornProtocol documentation and comments in netunicorn-base package.

## Folder structure
This project establishes a certain folder structure.

### `src` folder
All the code is located in `src` folder. You can freely create other folders for documentation, tests, etc.  
Note that if you create a Python package with setuptools, you'll need to 
specify the `src` folder as the root of the package.  
For example, for pyproject.toml you need to add the next lines:
```toml
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
```

The `pyproject.toml` template in this repository already contains these lines.

### `netunicorn/contrib/connectors` folder
netunicorn project uses namespace packages for separate distribution of parts
of the project. Please, read about namespace packages in Python documentation:
[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/).

Brief rules about our namespace packages:
- It's better to place your modules in `netunicorn/contrib` folder. In the particular case of connectors - in 
  `netunicorn/contrib/connectors` folder.
- You should not create `__init__.py` files in `netunicorn` and `netunicorn/contrib` folders, but you can create them
  in subfolders of `netunicorn/contrib` folder.
- After installation of your package, your modules will be available as `netunicorn.contrib.connectors.<your_module_name>`.
